## Overview


The Urbit Foundation monitors existing and new issues in the codebase to identify issues that can be addressed by community contributors. 

This bounty will close any three of the issues labeled ["community contribution"](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/labels/community%20contribution) in the Urbit github repo.

The ideal contributor will have a decent command of hoon and an understanding of the Urbit stack, but the issues are selected to minimize need for deep context.

For clarification on any of the issues, please mention [@vvisigoth](https://github.com/vvisigoth) or the issue filer in the issue comments.
