At the beginning, Urbit was just a few people with the right combination of imagination and discipline to try to rebuild computing.

**2002**  
Urbit starts as the open-ended personal project of computer scientist and loquacious writer Curtis Yarvin. An “independent study PhD” to reinvent computing for a network-centric world.

**2008**  
Nock, the foundation of Urbit, works. Coming in at 32 lines of code, that’s 1 line of code every two months.

**2012**  
Hoon, Urbit’s programming language, compiles itself to Nock. Writing Hoon is much easier than writing Nock.

**2013**  
Arvo, Urbit’s OS kernel, boots and the first live Urbit network is started with a command-line chat.

**2014**  
Tlon is founded to help support Urbit development (and is < 8 people for the next four years).

**2015**  
Urbit has its first web interface and serves its own website.

**2016**  
The first sale of Urbit address space sells out in four hours.

**2017**  
Our test network runs for ten months without a reboot.

Our private sale, shared only with our mailing list, sells out in six hours — limit two per person.

**2018**  
Tlon sells about 8% of its stake in the network to accelerate Urbit development. Urbit.live gets going and starts selling Urbit IDs to the public.

**2019**  
Tlon spends the year stabilizing Arvo and building Landscape.

**2021**  
Tlon hosts the first Urbit Assembly and the Urbit Foundation is formally organized.

**2022**  
The Urbit Foundation hosts the second Assembly companies like Native Planet, Holium, and Tirrel present their vision for the future of Urbit.

**2023**\
The Urbit Foundation takes over core development leadership from Tlon, and Tlon begins focusing on their vision for products on Urbit.

Building Urbit is about building a future where technology doesn’t control us. Instead, we look forward to a future where technology is simpler, more reliable and less invasive.
