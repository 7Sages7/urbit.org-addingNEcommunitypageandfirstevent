Urbit ships with a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) called [Dojo](https://developers.urbit.org/overview/dojo). This will give you command line control over the system and many applications.  But there are also an increasing number of graphical user interfaces. By default, Urbit ships with [Landscape](https://tlon.io/landscape), which serves as a simple visual way to install and open other applications.  It also comes with a suite of basic apps: Groups, Talk, (and soon Gallery and Notebooks).

Landscape embodies [Tlon](https://tlon.io/)’s vision of a foundation for a set of digital basics – core features like chats, notebooks, and galleries that help you organize your digital life.  Landscape runs in the web browser, so you can access it like any other web application.

In addition to Landscape, companies such as [Tirrel](https://tirrel.io/) and [Holium](https://www.holium.com/) have created cross-platform desktop applications that run on OSX, Linux, or Windows.  These applications offer additional features and built-in window management for Urbit applications, so the experience using them is much closer to using a different version of OSX or Windows that’s optimized to run on a decentralized network. 

There’s no limit to the variety of interfaces that can be built on top of Urbit.  They can be as simple or complex as necessary for the needs of the people who use them.

Interfaces are the result of Urbit’s composable architecture: it’s very easy for applications to talk to each other.  This means that there’s no need for redundancy in data entry or functionality.  If one application does one thing well, another can easily integrate the data from another application into its processes.  For example the Talk application can reference a message posted in a Group.  No need for a screenshot, and no need for an API.

In the [Realm](https://urbit.org/applications/~lomder-librun/realm) interface, messages from [Talk](/applications/~sogryp-dister-dozzod-marzod/talk) are directly integrated into the desktop interface.  No need to use the application, it’s already there.  On Urbit, programs all speak a common language, which makes putting them together into a unique interface not only possible but much simpler than connecting traditional web or native applications.
