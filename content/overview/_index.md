The personal computer aimed to become a bicycle for the human mind, a joy to use as either a beginner or a savant. Instead, our computers too often use us instead of us using them. Distraction, attention traps, and hostile interfaces clutter our mental environment. Is the problem with computing itself or only with the computers we've been given?

Urbit is a unified and comprehensible computer for the 21st century. It comes bundled with a suite of digital basics to help you connect with others right away. Run it how you want: on a laptop, a cloud hosting provider or a server in your home. If you're curious about the code, it's simple to understand. If you're not, it's still simple enough to trust.

For developers, Urbit offers the best platform for building composable peer to peer applications. An identity system, blockchain integration and encrypted network come free of charge. 

For users, Urbit has communication tools, personal software, and interesting people—everything you need to build or join a thriving community. Our—soon your—ecosystem grows by the day and every application builds on the last. Who knows what’s next?
