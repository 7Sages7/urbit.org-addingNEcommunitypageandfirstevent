The Urbit ecosystem brings together users and developers of all stripes, but they  all share a common set of values.  They believe in the original vision of the internet – a network of individuals and organizations who own their information and their computation, and voluntarily share resources towards a common good.

At the time of this writing, the Urbit ecosystem is made up of over a [dozen organizations](/ecosystem?type=organizations), ten regular [meetup groups](/ecosystem?type=communities) across the world, ten [marketplaces](/ecosystem?type=marketplaces), dozens of [applications](/ecosystem?type=applications), and countless [groups](/ecosystem?type=groups) on the network. (Since Urbit is uncensorable and encrypted, we literally cannot tell you how many groups there may be.)

There are currently two principal organizations involved in Urbit’s development and maintenance: [Tlon](https://tlon.io) and the Urbit Foundation.

Tlon is the original company behind Urbits inception, and has been around since 2013 or so.

Up until 2023 Tlon primarily focused on Urbit core development.  In early 2023, the Urbit Foundation formerly took over the role of core development leadership.  Tlon continues to support core development efforts while focusing on their own Urbit products and services.

The Urbit Foundation was formally established in 2021. The Foundation runs the grants program, maintains urbit.org, the [network explorer](https://network.urbit.org/), organizes [events](https://urbit.org/events) like [Assembly](https://assembly.urbit.org/), and now leads core development.

Other organizations that contribute to Urbit include [Uqbar](https://uqbar.network/), who are is developing a ZK rollup for Urbit, bringing Urbit developers the best of Ethereum’s guarantees. [Holium](https://holium.com)’s [Realm](https://urbit.org/applications/~lomder-librun/realm) represents the next generation of collaborative work and play for groups and DAOs on Urbit. [Tirrel](https://tirrel.io) is developing a suite of applications for content creators and their communities including publishing, a desktop interface and fiat payment rails.

Outside of formal organization the community of contributors and core developers has been steadily contributing to the codebase since before Tlon existed, and they’re still going strong. They can primarily be found on Urbit itself, in the [Urbit Community](/groups/~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community) group, the [urbit-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/g/dev) mailing list and on [GitHub](https://github.com/urbit).
