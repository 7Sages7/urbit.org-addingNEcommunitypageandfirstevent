### 1. Get oriented

After you've logged into your Urbit for the first time, you're officially an Urbiter! You've unlocked the entire Urbit network with your newly-minted ID — the key to your new digital life.

You'll see your Home and a few pre-installed applications: Terminal, Groups, and Bitcoin. More on them in a moment.

Above those are buttons to view System Preferences and Help and Support and check out notifications for newly-installed or recently-updated applications, respectively. The search bar helps you surface applications you already have installed, or discover developers and applications across the Urbit network.

You'll likely want to focus on finding and joining new communities, which you can do with the **Groups** app. Click on the box to open the application.

### 2. Join a few groups with fellow Urbiters

No two people will ever have the same experience on Urbit. That depends entirely on who you find and where they invite you to join them. But we can set you down a good path.

First, Open the Groups app.

Then click on "Find Groups" in the left column. Enter [~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community](/groups/~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community) — the official Urbit community. Click the "Join" button when you see the group listing.

Give it a minute, and the group will load its default channels. To join additional channels in the group, click the "All Channels" button.

Here are a few more useful groups to join:

- [`~rondev/group-discovery`](/groups/~rondev/group-discovery): A group for finding other groups.
- [`~middev/the-forge`](/groups/~middev/the-forge): A group for sharing, discussing, and discovering new Urbit applications.
- [`~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon`](/groups/~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon): A community around [Uqbar](https://uqbar.network), a company creating applications and experiences on top of Urbit — notably EScape, which is an alternative to the default Groups application for joining communities and messaging with other Urbiters.

### 3. Get more Urbit apps

Groups are great, but Urbit goes way deeper with apps that are developed specifically for Urbit and use P2P networking for everything.

We'll use [Canvas](/applications/~dister-norsyr-torryn/canvas) — a collaborative app for creating pixel art with others — as an example to show the process.

Head back to your Urbit's home — the URL you used to log in and view your preinstalled apps. From there, click on the search bar and enter `~dister-norsyr-torryn/canvas`. Click on the first result, which shows you details about the developer, the license, a website for more information, and when the app was last updated.

Click **Get App**, then **Get "Canvas"** to continue. Your Urbit gets to work, and once installation is finished, click Open App to see it in action.

Some popular apps to get things moving:

- [EScape](/applications/~dister-fabnev-hinmur/escape): An alternative UI to the core groups, communities, and messaging capabilities in Urbit.
- [Studio](/applications/~tirrel/studio): Run a blog on your urbit.
- [Wrdu](/applications/~magped-magped-rabsef-bicrym/wrdu): A Wordle clone.

Discover more applications on the [Ecosystem page](https://urbit.org/ecosystem?type=applications).

### 4. Get help

If you need help getting around Urbit, the best place to go is the official Urbit community: [`~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community`](/groups/~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community). Those in the Help channel are willing to troubleshoot or provide links to resources to help you get out of a jam.

That community isn't for every support request, however. If your question involves an app, you're better served reaching out to the developer — for example, if you have an issue with EScape's notifications feature, reach out to Uqbar in [`~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon`](/groups/~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon).

If you're having trouble with your planet or the hosting provider that's running your ship, try their support, as they'll have more context and resources to help solve your issue.

And if you can't get through this guide and launch into Urbit, you may have luck with the [Urbit Live community](https://t.me/UrbitLiveGroup) on Telegram.

### 5. What's next?

You made it! You did the work and now have your Final Computer.

What you do with it is up to you. Where you go from here is up to you. No two experiences on Urbit will be the same, so we encourage you to follow your own intuition and explore.

**Learn more about using Urbit**: Check out the [Operators Site](https://operators.urbit.org/) to learn more about running your own Urbit and how the network functions.

**Get updates about Urbit**: [Subscribe](https://urbit.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=972a03db9e0c6c25bb58de8c8&id=be143888d2) to the Urbit Newsletter for news, blog posts, and events from the Urbit Foundation.

**Join an event or meetup**: Many of the organizations and people behind Urbit host virtual and in-person events on a regular basis — check out the latest on our [Events feed](/events/), or a local [Meetup group](/ecosystem?type=communities).

**Learn how to build on Urbit**: If you're the kind of person who wants to build applications directly for discerning communities with built-in identity and networking primitives, or even jump into the Urbit kernel's core, we have the most comprehensive information to get you started on the [Urbit Developers Site](https://developers.urbit.org/).
