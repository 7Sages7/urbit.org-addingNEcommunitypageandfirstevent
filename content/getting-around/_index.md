### 1. Get oriented

After you've logged into your Urbit for the first time, you'll see what we call Landscape – an interface for interacting with the network and applications.  You'll also see a few pre-installed applications: Terminal, Groups, and Talk. More on them in a moment.

Above those are buttons to view System Preferences and check out notifications for messages and application activity. The search bar helps you surface applications you already have installed, or discover developers and applications across the Urbit network.

You'll likely want to focus on finding and joining new communities, which you can do with the **Groups** app. Click on the box to open the application.

### 2. Join a few groups

Joining public groups is simple – just search for the group host's Urbit ID, and click join. Check out a walk-through of this process in the [Joining groups](/getting-around/joining-groups) guide.

### 3. Get more Urbit apps

Groups are great, but Urbit goes way deeper with apps that are developed specifically for Urbit and use P2P networking for everything.

Check out the [Installing apps](/getting-around/installing-applications) guide for a walk-through on the process of installing Urbit applications.


### 4. Get help

If you need help getting around Urbit, the best place to go is the official Urbit community: [`~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community`](/groups/~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community). Those in the Help channel are willing to troubleshoot or provide links to resources to help you get out of a jam.

That community isn't for every support request, however. If your question involves an app, you're better served reaching out to the developer — for example, if you have an issue with EScape's notifications feature, reach out to Uqbar in [`~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon`](/groups/~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon).

If you're having trouble with your planet or the hosting provider that's running your ship, try their support, as they'll have more context and resources to help solve your issue.

And if you can't get through this guide and launch into Urbit, you may have luck with the [Urbit Live community](https://t.me/UrbitLiveGroup) on Telegram.



### 5. What's next?


**Learn more about using Urbit**: Check out the [Operators Site](https://operators.urbit.org/) to learn more about running your own Urbit and how the network functions.

**Get updates about Urbit**: [Subscribe](https://urbit.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=972a03db9e0c6c25bb58de8c8&id=be143888d2) to the Urbit Newsletter for news, blog posts, and events from the Urbit Foundation.

**Join an event or meetup**: Many of the organizations and people behind Urbit host virtual and in-person events on a regular basis — check out the latest on our [Events feed](/events/), or a local [Meetup group](/ecosystem?type=communities).

**Learn how to build on Urbit**: If you're the kind of person who wants to build applications directly for discerning communities with built-in identity and networking primitives, or even jump into the Urbit kernel's core, we have the most comprehensive information to get you started on the [Urbit Developers Site](https://developers.urbit.org/).
