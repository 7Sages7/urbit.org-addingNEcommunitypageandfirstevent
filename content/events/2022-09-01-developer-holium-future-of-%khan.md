~littel-wolfur will be talking about the history and state of %khan, a new thread orchestrator vane in Urbit. He will go over its usage in apps like the discord bot by ~midsum-salrux, how it makes thread interaction much easier, and how future %khan clients will make native noun communication possible. There will be a simple demo of a naive client at the end of the talk.

~littel-wolfur is a longtime Urbit contributor currently working on devex for smart contracts at Uqbar.
